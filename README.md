# Working With Google Earth Engine (GEE)

Working with GEE enables users to analyze and visualize large datasets of geospatial information efficiently within a coding interface that supports real-time data manipulation and markdown annotations.

#### Current Examples:

1. [Wildfire land change detections](https://github.com/Fangsheng-Zhou/Working_With_GEE/blob/102d191a7c8e90e8fd348c6f8a0fe83fbf783372/Examples/Land_Changes_Wildfires_With_GEE.ipynb)
